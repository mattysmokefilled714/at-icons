**@icons** is a free and open-source library of 400 vector (SVG) icons you can use as custom node icons in your Godot projects or plugins, designed to fit with the existing set of editor icons, and optimized using [svgo](https://svgo.dev/).

Each icon is designed on a 16×16 grid, with color variants corresponding to every node type. They're also configured to work with any editor theme and scaling settings out of the box!

## Installing

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/voxybuns/at-icons/releases/latest) of **@icons**, and extract it into the root of your Godot project's folder. If you wish to use the icons in your plugin or addon, you can also copy individual icons along with their respective `.import` files into your plugin's folder, along with the library's license.

## Applying custom node icons

To apply an icon to a node or class, add the [`@icon` annotation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@gdscript.html#class-gdscript-annotation-icon) to your node's script followed by the path to the desired icon in parentheses and quotes **before** the class declaration, like so:

```gdscript
@icon ("res://addons/at-icons/node/bunny.svg")
class_name MyNode
extends Node
```

You might need to close and open the scene again for the icon change to occur.

## Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the project!

For the time being, I won't accept pull requests containing new icons to ensure consistency. However, you can suggest a new icon or report problems with existing icons by opening up a [new issue](https://github.com/voxybuns/at-icons/issues/new/choose). I will try to address them to the best of my abilities!
